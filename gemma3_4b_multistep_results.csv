Q: ((7 - 5 * 7 + -1) + (6 * 4 - 9 + -7)) =

A: Let’s think step by step.
First, we need to solve the expressions within the parentheses.

Let’s start with the first set of parentheses: (7 - 5 * 7 + -1)

1.  **Multiplication:** 5 * 7 = 35
    So, the expression becomes (7 - 35 + -1)
2.  **Addition and Subtraction** (from left to right):
    *   7 - 35 = -28
    *   -28 + (-1) = -29

Now let's look at the second set of parentheses: (6 * 4 - 9 + -7)

1.  **Multiplication:** 6 * 4 = 24
    So, the expression becomes (24 - 9 + -7)
2.  **Addition and Subtraction** (from left to right):
    *   24 - 9 = 15
    *   15 + (-7) = 15 - 7 = 8

First, let's simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses:

Next, let's simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses:
(-1 - -4 * -7 * 2)

Now, we multiply the results:
-60 * 27

= - (60 * (20 + 7))
= - (60 * 20 + 60 * 7)
= - (1200 + 420)
= -1620

Alternatively, we can calculate:
-60 * 27
= - (60 * 27)
= - (60 * (20 + 7))
= - (60 * 20 + 60 * 7)
= - (1200 + 420) = -1620

Alternatively, we can calculate

and
(-1 - -4 * -7 * 2) = (-1 - (-56)) = (-1 + 56) = 55

So we have -60 * 55 = -(60 * 55) = -(60 * (50 + 5)) = -(3000 + 300) = -3300.

Let's redo the calculation.

First Parenthesis:
(-5 - -1 - 7 * 8) = (-5 + 1 - 56) = (-4 - 56) = -60

Second Parenthesis:
(-1 - -4 * -7 * 2) = (-1 - (-56)) = (-1 + 56) = 55

Finally,
-60 * 55 = -(60 * 55) = -(60 * (50 + 5)) = -(3000 + 300) = -3300.

Let's do it another way:
(-5 - -1 - 7 * 8) = (-5+1) - 56 = -4 - 56 = -60
(-1 - -4 * -7 * 2) = -1 - (4*(-7*2)) = -1 - (-56) = -1 + 56 = 55
-60 * 55 = -3300.

Let's calculate B = (9 + 8 * -6 * -1) = (9 + (8 * -6 * -1)) = (9 + (8 * -6 * -1)) = (9 + (48 * -1)) = (9 + (-48)) = 9 - 48 = -39.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -3 - (-39) = -3 + 39 = 36. So the answer is 36.

((8 * 3 - -1 - -3) * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3)) =,7056,"Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Q: ((8 * 3 - -1 - -3) * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3)) =

A: Let's think step by step.
We need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).  First, we'll handle the parentheses and exponents.

1. **Inside the Parentheses:**
   *  (8 * 3 - -1 - -3)
   *  First, perform the multiplication: 8 * 3 = 24
   *  Now we have: (24 - -1 - -3)
   *  Next, simplify the subtraction/addition inside the parentheses: 24 - -1 = 25, and 25 - -3 = 25 + 3 = 28.

2. **Second Parentheses:**
   * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3)
   *  Multiply from left to right:
      * -4 * 7 = -28
      * -28 * -3 = 84
      * 84 * 3 = 252

3. **Final Calculation:**
   * (28) * (252)
   * 28 * 252 = (20 + 8) * 252 = 20 * 252 + 8 * 252 = 5040 + 2016 = 7056

Therefore, ((8 * 3 - -1 - -3) * (-4 * 7 * -3 * 3)) = 7056.

A: Let's think step by step.
We need to evaluate the expression ((5 + 3 - 6 + 1) + (-5 + 5 - 6 - 4)).  We'll follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: (5 + 3 - 6 + 1).
5 + 3 = 8
8 - 6 = 2
2 + 1 = 3

So, the first part of the expression is equal to 3.

Now, let's simplify the second part of the expression: (-5 + 5 - 6 - 4).
-5 + 5 = 0
0 - 6 = -6
-6 - 4 = -10

So, the second part of the expression is equal to -10.

Now, we need to add the results of the two parts: 3 + (-10).
3 + (-10) = 3 - 10 = -7.

Therefore, the answer is -7.

((9 + 6 - 9 + 8) * (9 - -9 * -6 + -2)) =,-658,"Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and subtraction (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as ""A * B"", where A = (9 + 6 - 9 + 8) and B = (9 - -9 * -6 + -2).
Let's calculate A = (9 + 6 - 9 + 8) = (9 + 6) + (-9 + 8) = 15 + (-1) = 15 - 1 = 14.
Let's calculate B = (9 - -9 * -6 + -2) = (9 - (9 * -6) + -2) = (9 - (-54) + -2) = (9 + 54 + -2) = (63 + -2) = 61.
Then, the final equation is A * B = 14 * 61.
Now we can multiply 14 * 61.
14 * 61 = 14 * (60 + 1) = (14 * 60) + (14 * 1) = 840 + 14 = 854.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses:
(4 - -6 + -9 + -7)
= (4 + 6 - 9 - 7)
= (10 - 9 - 7)
= (1 - 7)
= -6

Next, let's simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses:
(9 + -3 - -7 * -8)
= (9 - 3 - 7 * -8)
= (6 - 7 * -8)
= (6 - 56)
= -50

Now, we have:
(-50) - (-6)
= -50 + 6
= -44

Therefore, the answer is -44.

((8 - -9 * 4 * 9) * (-4 * -3 * 7 * 9)) =,250992,"Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Q: ((8 - -9 * 4 * 9) * (-4 * -3 * 7 * 9)) =

A: Let’s think step by step.
We need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, let’s simplify the expression inside the first parentheses:
(8 - -9 * 4 * 9)
First, we do the multiplication: 9 * 4 * 9 = 36 * 9 = 324
So, we have (8 - 324) = -316

Next, let's simplify the second parentheses:
(-4 * -3 * 7 * 9)
= (12 * 7 * 9)
= (84 * 9)
= 756

Now, we multiply the results from the two parentheses:
(-316) * (756)

Let's perform the multiplication:
-316 * 756 = -(316 * 756)

To calculate 316 * 756, we can use the distributive property:
316 * (700 + 50 + 6) = 316 * 700 + 316 * 50 + 316 * 6
316 * 700 = 221200
316 * 50 = 15800
316 * 6 = 1896
So, 316 * 756 = 221200 + 15800 + 1896 = 221200 + 17996 = 239196

Therefore, the final answer is -239196.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{-239196}$"

((-1 + 2 - 9 + 0) * (0 - -2 + -6 - 2)) =,48,"Let's think step by step.
Let's recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and subtraction (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as ""A * B"", where A = (-1 + 2 - 9 + 0) and B = (0 - -2 + -6 - 2).
Let's calculate A = (-1 + 2 - 9 + 0) = (-1 + 2) - 9 + 0 = 1 - 9 + 0 = -8 + 0 = -8.
Let's calculate B = (0 - -2 + -6 - 2) = (0 + 2 - 6 - 2) = (2 - 6 - 2) = (2 - 6) - 2 = -4 - 2 = -6.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -6 * -6 = 36. So the answer is 36."
