((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)) =,63,"<think>
I need to solve the expression ((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - (-6 * -3 * 1))). I'll follow the order of operations step by step.

First, I'll handle the multiplication inside each parenthesis. Starting with the first part: (-9 * -5). Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result, so that's 45. Next, within the same parentheses, there's another multiplication: (-6 * -3) and then multiplied by 1. Multiplying these also results in 18.

Now I'll substitute these values back into the expression: (45 - 6 + (-2)) - (-8 - 18). Simplifying inside the first set of parentheses: 45 minus 6 is 39, and then subtracting 2 gives 37. In the second set of parentheses: negative 8 minus 18 equals -26.

The final expression becomes 37 - (-26), which is like adding 26 to 37, resulting in 63.

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step using the **order of operations** (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

\[
((-9 \times -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - (-6 \times -3 \times 1)))
\]

### Step 1: Perform Multiplications
1. **First Multiplication:**  
   \( (-9) \times (-5) = 45 \)

2. **Second Multiplication:**  
   \( (-6) \times (-3) = 18 \)  
   Then, multiply by 1:  
   \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \)

### Step 2: Substitute Back into the Expression
\[
(45 - 6 + (-2)) - (-8 - 18)
\]

### Step 3: Perform Additions and Subtractions from Left to Right
1. **First Parentheses:**  
   \( 45 - 6 = 39 \)  
   Then, subtract 2:  
   \( 39 - 2 = 37 \)

2. **Second Parentheses:**  
   \( (-8) - (-18) = (-8) + 18 = 10 \)

### Step 4: Subtract the Two Results
\[
37 - 10 = 27

     \]

2. **Evaluate the second part inside the parentheses:**
   
   \[
   -2 + (-7) - 7 - (-7)
   \]
   
   - First, combine \(-2\) and \(-7\):
     \[

Inside the second set of parentheses, we have:
\[
-1 \times 7 \times -6 + (-2)
\]
Multiply sequentially from left to right:

1. \(-1 \times 7 = -7\)
2. \(-7 \times -6 = 42\)
3. \(42 + (-2) = 40\)

So, the second set simplifies to:
\[
40

First, I'll evaluate the first set of parentheses: 6 - 0 * 5 + (-3).

According to the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So, I should calculate 0 * 5 first. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, this simplifies the expression.

After that, I'll handle the remaining operations from left to right: 6 - 0 + (-3). Performing these sequentially gives me the result for the first set of parentheses.

Next, I'll evaluate the second set of parentheses: 6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7).

When dealing with negative numbers within an expression, it's important to distribute the negative sign correctly. Starting with 6 - (-7), this becomes 6 + 7. Then, subtracting (-2) adds 2 to the result, and finally, subtracting (-7) adds another 7.

By following these steps, I'll determine the value of the second set of parentheses.

Finally, I'll multiply the results of both sets of parentheses together to obtain the final answer.

((-5 - 4 * -8 + 8) * (4 + 3 - 9 * 7)) =,-1960,"<think>
First, I'll tackle each part inside the parentheses separately.

For the first expression, (-5 - 4 * -8 + 8), I need to perform the multiplication before addition and subtraction. Calculating (-4) multiplied by (-8) gives positive 32. Then, subtracting this from -5 results in -37. Finally, adding 8 gives a total of -29.

Next, for the second expression, (4 + 3 - 9 * 7), I'll perform the multiplication first. Calculating 9 multiplied by 7 gives 63. Adding 4 and 3 equals 7, then subtracting 63 results in -56.

Now, multiplying the two results together: (-29) multiplied by (-56) equals positive 1,624.
</think>

Sure! Let's solve the arithmetic problem step by step.

**Problem:**
\[
((-5 - 4 \times -8 + 8) \times (4 + 3 - 9 \times 7)) = ?
\]

**Solution:**

We'll solve this problem using the **order of operations** (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets**
2. **Exponents/Orders**
3. **Multiplication and Division** (from left to right)
4. **Addition and Subtraction** (from left to right)

Let's break down each part.

### Step 1: Simplify the first parenthesis \((-5 - 4 \times -8 + 8)\)

- **Multiply** first:
  \[
  -4 \times -8 = 32
  \]
  
- **Subtract**:
  \[
  -5 - 32 = -37
  \]
  
- **Add** the last number:
  \[
  -37 + 8 = -29
  \]
  
So, 
\[
(-5 - 4 \times -8 + 8) = \boxed{-29}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the second parenthesis \((4 + 3 - 9 \times 7)\)

- **Multiply** first:
  \[
  9 \times 7 = 63
  \]
  
- **Add** the first two numbers:
  \[
  4 + 3 = 7
  \]
  
- **Subtract**:
  \[
  7 - 63 = -56
  \]
  
So,
\[
(4 + 3 - 9 \times 7) = \boxed{-56}
\]

### Step 3: Multiply the two results together

\[
-29 \times (-56) = 1,624
\]

To solve the expression ((7 - 4 + (-3) * 4) - (5 + (-8) - 6 + (-5))), I'll follow the order of operations.

First, I'll evaluate each part inside the parentheses separately. Starting with the first set: (7 - 4 + (-3) * 4). Inside this, I'll perform multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, (-3) * 4 equals -12. Then, 7 - 4 is 3. Adding these together gives 3 + (-12), which equals -9.

((5 * -8 - -5 * -9) * (2 - -7 * 6 - 4)) =,-3400,"<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this arithmetic problem step by step. Let me see... The question is ((5 * -8 - -5 * -9) * (2 - -7 * 6 - 4)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but if I break it down, it should be manageable.

First off, I remember the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and then addition and subtraction. So I should handle what's inside each set of parentheses first before doing the rest.

Let me tackle the first part: 5 * -8 - (-5) * -9. Okay, so within this part, there are two multiplications and a subtraction. I need to compute those multiplications before dealing with the subtraction.

Starting with 5 * -8. Multiplying a positive by a negative gives a negative, right? So that's 5 times -8 is... let me do 5*8=40, so since one of them is negative, it should be -40. Got that: 5*-8 = -40.

Next up is -(-5)*-9. Hmm, let's break this down. First, there's a negative sign in front of (-5), which would make it positive. So it becomes +5 * -9. Now, multiplying a positive by a negative gives a negative result. 5*9=45, so 5*-9 is -45.

So now, putting that back into the first part: -40 - (-45). Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive. So it's like -40 + 45. Hmm, 45 minus 40 is 5, but since one of them is negative, -40 + 45 would be... 5? Wait, let me double-check that. No, wait: negative forty plus forty-five. That's the same as 5 because you're adding 45 to a debt of 40, which leaves you with a positive 5.

Wait, hold on. Is that right? Let me see: -40 minus (-45) is equal to -40 + 45, yes. And -40 plus 45... since 45 is bigger than 40, the result should be positive 5. So first part simplifies to 5. Okay, that seems correct.

Now moving on to the second part: (2 - (-7)*6 - 4). Again, let's handle the operations inside step by step. Here, I see a multiplication and a subtraction of a negative term, so order of operations applies here too.

First, calculate -7 * 6. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, right? So that should be... (-7)*6= -42? Wait no, wait: no, actually, no. If it's negative seven multiplied by six, that would be -42 because one of them is negative. But wait, hold on, the expression is 2 minus (-7*6) minus 4.

So let me parse this correctly. It's 2 minus [(-7)*6] minus 4. So first compute (-7)*6, which is -42. Then subtract that result from 2 and then subtract 4.

Wait no, it's (2 - (-7*6)) - 4. Let me do the multiplication first: (-7)*6 = -42. Then, 2 minus (-42) is like adding 42 to 2, which gives 44. So now we have 44 minus 4, right? Because after that, it's (44) - 4.

So 44 minus 4 is 40. Therefore, the second part simplifies to 40. Got that.

Now, putting both parts together: The first part was 5 and the second part was 40. So we have (5 * 40). Multiplying those together should give 200 because 5*40=200.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in my calculations. Let's double-check each part.

Starting with the first parenthesis: 5*(-8) = -40; then (-5)*-9 is +45 because negative times negative is positive. Then subtracting that from -40, so it's -40 - (-45). Subtracting a negative is adding a positive: -40 + 45 = 5. Yep, that seems right.

Second parenthesis: Start with 2; then -(-7)*6, which is like multiplying by positive 7*6, but wait no: (-7)*6 is -42. So 2 - (-42) is 2 + 42 = 44. Then subtract 4 from that, so 44 - 4 = 40. That's correct.

Then multiplying the two results: 5 * 40 = 200. Hmm... but wait a second, let me see. Did I do the order correctly? Because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Let me re-examine the first parenthesis again: (5*-8 - (-5)*-9). So that's 5*(-8) is indeed -40; and then (-5)*(-9) is +45 because negative times negative is positive. So we have -40 minus 45, but wait hold on, no.

Wait a minute! Did I misread the first part? Let me parse it again: 5 * (-8) is -40, correct. Then, subtracting (-5)*-9, which is subtracting a positive number because (-5)*(-9)=45, right? So actually, it's -40 minus 45. Wait, that would be negative.

Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier here. Let me re-examine this carefully.

First parenthesis: (5 * -8) - (-5 * -9). That is, 5*(-8)= -40; then (-5)*(-9)= +45 because two negatives make a positive. So it's -40 minus 45. Which would be... -40 minus 45 is equal to -85.

Wait, hold on, so I think earlier when I did that part, I thought of subtracting a negative and added. But no: the expression is (5 * -8) - [(-5)*-9], which is (-40) - (45). So that's like saying -40 minus 45, which is indeed -85.

So that changes things. Previously, I thought it was -40 minus (-45), but actually, no: the structure is subtracting the entire product of (-5)*(-9)=45, so it's -40 minus 45, not -40 minus (-45).

So that corrects my earlier mistake. So the first part should be -85.

Now let me check the second parenthesis again to see if I messed up somewhere else.

Second parenthesis: (2 - (-7)*6 - 4). So, as before, compute (-7)*6= -42. Then 2 - (-42)= 2 +42=44; then subtract 4 from that, so 44-4=40. That seems correct.

So now, if the first part is -85 and the second part is 40, then multiplying them together: (-85) * (40). Let's do that.

Multiplying a negative by a positive gives a negative result. So, -85*40. Hmm, 85*40=3400, so this would be -3400.

Wait a minute, so that changes everything. Earlier, I thought the first part was 5 and the second was 40, which gave me 200, but it's actually -85 * 40= -3400. So my initial mistake was in misinterpreting the subtraction within the parentheses.

So let me go back through this step by step to make sure.

Original problem: ((5 * -8 - (-5) * -9) * (2 - (-7)*6 -4)).

First parenthesis:
5 * -8 = -40. Then, subtracting [(-5)*-9]. So that's (-5)*(-9)= +45. Therefore, it's -40 -45= -85.

Second parenthesis:
(2 - [(-7)*6] -4). Compute inside: (-7)*6=-42. So 2 - (-42) is 44; then subtracting 4: 44-4=40.

Then multiply the two results: (-85)*40 = -3400.

So that's quite different from my initial answer of 200, which was incorrect because I misread the first parenthesis as subtracting a negative and adding instead of subtracting a positive number. So now, after correcting myself, the correct result is -3400.

But wait, let me just confirm once more by breaking down each part separately.

First parenthesis:
5 * (-8) = -40.
(-5)*(-9): Negative times negative is positive, so 45.
So we have: -40 - 45. Which is indeed -85.

Second parenthesis:
2 minus [(-7)*6] minus 4.
Compute (-7)*6 first: That's -42.
So it becomes 2 - (-42) = 2 +42=44; then subtracting 4 gives 40.

Multiply those two results: (-85)*40. Let me compute that:
-85 * 40 is the same as -(85*40).
85*40: Well, 80*40=3200 and 5*40=200, so total is 3400.
So with the negative sign: -3400.

Therefore, after carefully re-examining each step, I can confirm that the correct result is -3400.

I think earlier, when I first did this problem, I misread the expression in the first parenthesis and incorrectly assumed that it was subtracting a negative, leading me to an incorrect positive result. Upon reviewing, it's clear that subtracting 45 from -40 gives -85, which then leads to the final product of -3400.

So, I should remember to always double-check each operation, especially when dealing with multiple negatives and parentheses, as misreading them can lead to significant errors in the calculations.
</think>

The solution involves evaluating two separate expressions and then multiplying their results. 

First, calculate \(5 \times (-8) = -40\). Then, compute \((-5) \times (-9) = 45\). Subtract this result from \(-40\) giving \(-40 - 45 = -85\).

Next, evaluate the second expression: \(2 - (-42) = 44\) after computing \(-7 \times 6 = -42\), and then subtract 4 to get \(44 - 4 = 40\).

Finally, multiply the two results: \(-85 \times 40 = -3400\).

**Answer:** \(\boxed{-3400}\)"
((6 + 1 - 4 - 3) - (-4 * -6 * -3 + 1)) =,71,"<think>
First, I will evaluate each part of the expression separately by following the order of operations.

Starting with the first parentheses:
(6 + 1 - 4 - 3) = 7 - 4 - 3 = (7 - 4) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0

Next, I will simplify the second part inside the second set of parentheses:
(-4 * -6 * -3 + 1)
Multiplying the numbers: (-4) * (-6) = 24; then, 24 * (-3) = -72
Adding 1 to the result: -72 + 1 = -71

Now, subtracting this value from the first parentheses:
0 - (-71) = 0 + 71 = 71

Therefore, the final answer is 71.

((-9 - -9 + 0 + -3) + (-2 - -1 - 1 + 2)) =,-3,"<think>
First, I need to evaluate the expression inside each set of parentheses separately.

For the first part:
- Start with (-9 - -9), which simplifies to -9 + 9 = 0.
- Then add 0, so it remains 0.
- Next, subtract 3: 0 - 3 = -3.

So, the first part equals -3.

For the second part:
- Begin with (-2 - -1) = -2 + 1 = -1.
- Subtract 1 from that result: -1 - 1 = -2.
- Finally, add 2 to get -2 + 2 = 0.

Now, combine both results:

Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

**Problem:**
\[
((-9 - (-9) + 0 + (-3)) + (-2 - (-1) - 1 + 2))

((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4)) =,25,"<think>
First, I need to simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: (9 - 3 + 2 + -1). Following the order of operations, I'll perform each arithmetic operation from left to right. This gives me 9 minus 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, and then subtracting 1 results in 7.

Next, I'll tackle the second set of parentheses: (5 - -1 - -6 * -4). Again, following the order of operations, multiplication comes before subtraction. So, I'll first calculate -6 multiplied by -4, which equals 24. Then, substituting back into the expression, it becomes 5 minus -1 is 6, and then subtracting -24 gives me 30.

Now, with both sets of parentheses simplified to 7 and 30 respectively, the original equation becomes 7 minus (30). Performing this subtraction results in -23.

Therefore, after carefully evaluating each part step by step and following the proper order of operations, the final answer is -23.
</think>

**Question:**
\[
((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 \times -4)) =

**Solution:**

Let's solve the equation step by step.

1. **Simplify the first parentheses:**
   \[
   9 - 3 + 2 + (-1)
   \]
   Perform operations from left to right:
   \[
   9 - 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + (-1) = 7
   \]

2. **Simplify the second parentheses:**
   \[
   5 - (-1) - (-6 \times -4)
   \]
   First, perform multiplication:
   \[
   -6 \times -4 = 24
   \]
   Then, substitute back into the expression:
   \[
   5 - (-1) = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 - 24 = -18

((-8 + 6 * -2 + 4) * (-4 * 5 + 2 - 8)) =,416,"<think>
Okay, so I need to solve this arithmetic problem step by step. The expression given is ((-8 + 6 * -2 + 4) * (-4 * 5 + 2 - 8)). Hmm, let me remember the order of operations: parentheses first, then multiplication and division from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction.

Starting with the first part inside the first set of parentheses: (-8 + 6 * -2 + 4). I need to handle the multiplication before anything else. So, 6 multiplied by -2 is... let me do that. 6 times -2 is -12. Now, substitute that back into the expression: (-8 + (-12) + 4). Next, perform the additions from left to right. Starting with -8 and -12, which gives me -20. Then, adding 4 to -20: -20 + 4 equals -16. So, the first part simplifies to -16.

Now moving on to the second set of parentheses: (-4 * 5 + 2 - 8). Again, multiplication comes first. Multiplying -4 by 5 gives me -20. Plugging that back in, it becomes (-20 + 2 - 8). Now, handling the additions and subtractions from left to right. Starting with -20 + 2: that's -18. Then subtracting 8 from -18: -18 - 8 equals -26. So, the second part simplifies to -26.

Now, I have to multiply these two results together: (-16) * (-26). Multiplying two negative numbers will give a positive result. Let me calculate that. 16 times 26 is... let's see, 10*26 is 260 and 6*26 is 156, so adding those gives 260 + 156 = 416. Since both were negative, the product is positive 416.

Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake there. Let me double-check my multiplication step. So, -16 times -26... 16 * 26: 10*26=260 and 6*26=156; adding those gives 260 + 156 = 416. Yes, that's correct because negative times negative is positive.

So, putting it all together: (-8 + 6*(-2) + 4) becomes -16 and (-4*5 + 2 -8) becomes -26. Multiplying these two results, we get (-16)*(-26)=416. 

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting with the first parentheses: -8 plus (6*-2) which is -12, so -8 + (-12) is -20; then adding 4 gives -16. Second parentheses: -4*5 is -20, plus 2 is -18, minus 8 is indeed -26. Multiplying those gives 416.

Yes, that seems right.
</think>

To solve the expression \(((\(-8 + 6 \times -2 + 4\)) \times (\(-4 \times 5 + 2 - 8\)))\), follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the first parentheses:**
   - Calculate \(6 \times -2 = -12\).
   - Substitute back into the expression: \((-8 + (-12) + 4)\).
   - Perform additions from left to right:
     - \(-8 + (-12) = -20\).
     - \(-20 + 4 = -16\).

2. **Simplify the second parentheses:**
   - Calculate \(-4 \times 5 = -20\).
   - Substitute back into the expression: \((-20 + 2 - 8)\).
   - Perform additions and subtractions from left to right:
     - \(-20 + 2 = -18\).
     - \(-18 - 8 = -26\).

3. **Multiply the results of the two parentheses:**
   - Multiply \(-16\) by \(-26\): \(-16 \times -26 = 416\).

Now, add 3 to this result: 3 + 42 = 45

Next, I'll evaluate the second part inside the main parentheses:

45 - 2 = 43

Therefore, the final answer is 43.

  \[
  -7 \times (-1) = 7

- **Add and subtract the remaining terms:**

  7 + (-5) - (-3) = 7 - 5 + 3 = 2

First, I need to evaluate each part of the expression inside the parentheses separately. Let's start with the first part: (1 - 6 * 0 - -7).

Inside this part, there are multiple operations that follow the order of operations. First, I should handle any multiplication before performing addition or subtraction.

The term ""6 * 0"" equals 0. So, the expression simplifies to (1 - 0 - (-7)). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding its positive counterpart, which makes it (1 + 7). Therefore, this part equals 8.

Next, I'll evaluate the second part of the expression: (6 * 0 + 6 - -3).

Again, following the order of operations, multiplication should be performed first. ""6 * 0"" is 0. So the expression simplifies to (0 + 6 - (-3)). Adding a positive number and subtracting a negative number can be combined into addition, resulting in (0 + 6 + 3). This part equals 9.

Now that I have both parts simplified, I can multiply them together: 8 * 9. Multiplying these gives 72.

((-5 + 6 - -5 + -6) + (-4 + -6 - 3 - 7)) =,-20,"<think>
Okay, so I've got this arithmetic problem here, and I need to solve it step by step. The question is ((-5 + 6 - -5 + -6) + (-4 + -6 - 3 - 7)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the negative signs and numbers, but I think I can handle it if I break it down.

First, let me rewrite the problem so I can see it better: ((-5 + 6 - (-5) + (-6)) + (-4 + (-6) - 3 - 7)). Alright, parentheses first. So I need to solve each part inside the big parentheses separately before combining them. 

Let's start with the left part: (-5 + 6 - (-5) + (-6)). Okay, so within this, there are more parentheses? Wait, no, it's just numbers and signs here. But I should remember the order of operations: do what's inside each set of parentheses first. So, let me compute that.

Breaking down the left part:
- Start with -5.
- Then add 6 to it. So, -5 + 6 is... hmm, subtracting 5 from 6 would be 1, so since it's negative 5 plus positive 6, that should be positive 1. Wait, no: actually, it's like 6 - 5 = 1, so yeah, it's 1.
- Next, subtract (-5). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive. So, 1 - (-5) becomes 1 + 5. That would be 6.
- Then, add (-6). Adding a negative is like subtracting. So, 6 + (-6) is the same as 6 - 6, which equals 0.

Okay, so the left part simplifies to 0. Cool, that was manageable.

Now, let's move on to the right part: (-4 + (-6) - 3 - 7). Again, I'll handle each operation step by step.

Starting with -4.
- Then add (-6). So, it's like subtracting 6 from -4. Hmm, so that would be -4 - 6. Which is... okay, negative 10.
- Next, subtract 3. So, -10 - 3 is... well, that's -13.
- Finally, subtract 7. So, -13 - 7 is... that should be -20.

So the right part simplifies to -20. 

Now, putting it all together: left part + right part = 0 + (-20). That would be 0 minus 20, which is -20.

Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have messed up somewhere. Let's go through the right part again step by step to make sure.

Starting over:
-4 + (-6) = -10. Then subtract 3: -10 - 3 = -13. Then subtract 7: -13 -7 is indeed -20. So that seems correct.

Now, double-checking the left part:
-5 + 6 = 1. Then subtract (-5): 1 + 5 = 6. Then add (-6): 6 - 6 = 0. That also checks out.

So combining both parts: 0 + (-20) is indeed -20. Hmm, so the answer should be -20. Let me write it as such.

Wait, but sometimes when dealing with negative numbers, signs can get tricky. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps?

Looking at the left part again:
-5 +6: yes, that's 1.
Then subtract (-5): which is adding 5, so 1 +5=6.
Add (-6): which is subtracting 6, so 6 -6=0. That seems right.

Right part:
Start with -4, add (-6)= -10
Subtract 3: -10-3=-13
Subtract 7: -13-7=-20. Yep, that's correct.

So overall, the expression simplifies to -20.

I think I did it correctly. But just to be thorough, let me write out each operation again.

Left part:
First term: -5
Second term: +6 → (-5) + 6 =1
Third term: -(-5)=+5 → 1 +5=6
Fourth term: +(-6)=-6 → 6 -6=0

Right part:
First term: -4
Second term:+(-6)=-6 → (-4) + (-6)= -10
Third term:-3 → -10 -3= -13
Fourth term:-7 → -13 -7= -20

Adding them together: 0 + (-20)= -20.

Yep, that's consistent. So I think the answer is indeed negative twenty.

Wait another thought: sometimes people might misread the operations or signs, especially with multiple negatives. Let me check if any of my steps have sign errors.

In the left part:
-5 +6=1 (correct)
Then -(-5)=+5 → 1+5=6 (correct)
Then +(-6)=-6 → 6-6=0 (correct)

Right part:
-4 + (-6)= -10 (correct)
Then -3: -10 -3= -13 (correct)
Then -7: -13-7= -20 (correct)

So no mistakes there.

Therefore, I can confidently say that the result of ((-5 + 6 - -5 + -6) + (-4 + -6 - 3 - 7)) is -20.
</think>

The expression simplifies as follows:

Step 1: Calculate the left part inside the first set of parentheses:
\[
(-5 + 6 - (-5) + (-6)) = (-5 + 6 + 5 - 6) = (1 + 5 - 6) = (6 - 6) = 0
\]

Step 2: Calculate the right part inside the second set of parentheses:
\[
(-4 + (-6) - 3 - 7) = (-4 - 6 - 3 - 7) = (-10 - 3 - 7) = (-13 - 7) = -20
\]

Step 3: Add both results together:
\[
0 + (-20) = -20

Next, I'll simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \(-3 * 0 * 8 + 6\). Multiplying \(-3\) by \(0\) gives \(0\), so the entire term becomes \(0 + 6 = 6\).

Now, subtracting the second result from the first: \(-3 - (-6) = -3 + 6 = 3\).

First, I will evaluate each part of the expression step by step.

Starting with the first parentheses:
-8 + (-6 * 9) - 7

Calculate multiplication first:
-6 * 9 = -54

-8 + (-54) - 7
= (-8 - 54) - 7
= -62 - 7
= -69

Next, I will evaluate the second parentheses:
8 + (2 * -9 * -7)

First, calculate the multiplication:

I need to solve the arithmetic expression: ((-3 * 0 * 4 - -7) + (-9 * -6 - -8 + 1)). 

First, I'll handle the multiplication operations inside the parentheses. 

For the first part, (-3 * 0 * 4), multiplying -3 by 0 gives 0, and then 0 multiplied by 4 is still 0. So this simplifies to (0 - -7). Subtracting a negative is like adding its positive counterpart, so 0 + 7 equals 7.

Next, for the second part, (-9 * -6), multiplying two negatives gives a positive result. Therefore, -9 times -6 equals 54. Then, subtracting -8 is the same as adding 8, bringing the total to 54 + 8 = 62. Finally, adding 1 gives 63.

((-8 + 0 * 0 * -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 * -2)) =,-20,"<think>
To solve the expression \((-8 + 0 \times 0 \times -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 \times -2)\), I'll follow the order of operations.

First, I'll evaluate the terms inside each parentheses separately. Starting with the first part, \(-8 + 0 \times 0 \times -1\):

- Multiplication is performed before addition, so \(0 \times 0 = 0\).
- Then, multiplying by \(-1\) gives \(0 \times -1 = 0\).
- Finally, adding to \(-8\) results in \(-8 + 0 = -8\).

Next, I'll evaluate the second part, \(7 + -1 + (-3) \times -2\):

- Multiplication comes first: \(-3 \times -2 = 6\).
- Then, adding \(-1\) to 7 gives \(7 + (-1) = 6\).
- Adding this to 6 results in \(6 + 6 = 12\).

Now, subtracting the second part from the first part:
\(-8 - 12 = -20\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(-20\).

Sure! Let's solve the multi-step arithmetic problem step by step.

**Problem:**
\[
((-8 + 0 \times 0 \times -1) - (7 + -1 + -3 \times -2)) 
\]

**Solution:**

1. **Evaluate each part inside the parentheses separately, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).**

   - **First Part:** \(-8 + 0 \times 0 \times -1\)

     - Perform multiplication first:
       \[
       0 \times 0 = 0
       \]
     - Then, multiply by \(-1\):
       \[
       0 \times (-1) = 0
       \]
     - Finally, add to \(-8\):
       \[
       -8 + 0 = -8
       \]

   - **Second Part:** \(7 + -1 + (-3) \times -2\)

     - Perform multiplication first:
       \[
       (-3) \times (-2) = 6
       \]
     - Then, add the numbers from left to right:
       \[
       7 + (-1) = 6
       \]
       \[
       6 + 6 = 12
       \]

   - **Now, subtract the second part from the first part:**
     \[
     -8 - 12 = -20
     \]

**Final Answer:**
\[

((-9 - -3 * 1 - -3) * (-9 - 5 - -2 * -7)) =,84,"<think>
First, I will identify and evaluate each of the two main parts inside the parentheses separately. 

Starting with the first part:
(-9 - -3 * 1 - -3)
I will perform multiplication before addition or subtraction.
-3 multiplied by 1 equals -3.
Now, substituting back: (-9 - (-3) - (-3))
This simplifies to -9 + 3 + 3, which totals 4.

Next, I'll evaluate the second part:
(-9 - 5 - -2 * -7)
Again, multiplication is performed first.
-2 multiplied by -7 equals 14.
Substituting back: (-9 - 5 - 14)
This adds up to -28.

Finally, I will multiply the results of both parts:
4 * (-28) equals -112.
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to solve the expression:

\[
((-9 - (-3 \times 1 - (-3))) \times (-9 - 5 - (-2 \times -7)))
\]

Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first part inside the parentheses

\[
-9 - (-3 \times 1 - (-3))
\]

1. **Multiplication:** Calculate \(-3 \times 1 = -3\).
2. **Subtraction inside parentheses:** Substitute back into the expression:
   \[
   -3 - (-3) = -3 + 3
   \]
3. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   -9 + 3 = -6
   \]

### Step 2: Simplify the second part inside the parentheses

\[
-9 - 5 - (-2 \times -7)
\]

1. **Multiplication:** Calculate \(-2 \times -7 = 14\).
2. **Subtraction inside parentheses:** Substitute back into the expression:
   \[
   -14
   \]
3. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   -9 - 5 + 14 = (-9 - 5) + 14 = -14 + 14 = 0
   \]

### Step 3: Multiply the results of both parts

\[
(-6) \times 0 = 0

((5 * -2 + 8 * 1) * (9 + -3 * -8 - -5)) =,-76,"<think>
First, I need to evaluate each part of the expression inside the parentheses separately. Let's start with the first part: \(5 \times -2 + 8 \times 1\).

Calculating \(5 \times -2\) gives me \(-10\). Then, calculating \(8 \times 1\) results in \(8\). Adding these two results together, \(-10 + 8\), equals \(-2\).

Next, I'll evaluate the second part: \(9 + (-3) \times -8 - (-5)\).

First, calculate \((-3) \times -8\), which is \(24\). Then, subtracting \(-5\) is the same as adding \(5\). So, adding these together with the initial \(9\) gives me \(9 + 24 + 5 = 38\).

Finally, I'll multiply the two results: \(-2 \times 38 = -76\).
</think>

Let's solve the expression step by step:

**Given Expression:**
\[
((5 \times -2 + 8 \times 1) \times (9 + (-3) \times -8 - (-5)))
\]

**Step 1: Evaluate the expressions inside each set of parentheses.**

1. **First Parentheses (\(A = 5 \times -2 + 8 \times 1\)):**
   \[
   5 \times -2 = -10
   \]
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8
   \]
   \[
   A = -10 + 8 = -2
   \]

2. **Second Parentheses (\(B = 9 + (-3) \times -8 - (-5)\)):**
   \[
   (-3) \times -8 = 24
   \]
   \[
   B = 9 + 24 - (-5)
   \]
   \[
   B = 9 + 24 + 5 = 38
   \]

**Step 2: Multiply the results of \(A\) and \(B\).**

\[
A \times B = (-2) \times 38 = -76
\]

((-7 * 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 * -6 * -4 * -6)) =,-1343,"<think>
To solve the expression \( ((-7 \times 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 \times -6 \times -4 \times -6)) \), I'll follow the order of operations.

First, I'll evaluate each part inside the parentheses separately. Starting with the first set:  
\[
(-7 \times 9 - -9 + 7)
\]  
I perform multiplication before subtraction and addition. So, \( -7 \times 9 = -63 \). Then, subtracting a negative is like adding its positive counterpart: \( -63 - (-9) = -63 + 9 = -54 \). Finally, I add 7 to get the result: \( -54 + 7 = -47 \).

Next, I'll tackle the second set inside the parentheses:  
\[
(9 \times -6 \times -4 \times -6)
\]  
Starting with multiplication from left to right: \( 9 \times -6 = -54 \). Then, multiplying by \( -4 \) gives \( -54 \times -4 = 216 \), and finally multiplying by \( -6 \) results in \( 216 \times -6 = -1296 \).

Now, I'll add the two results together:  
\[
-47 + (-1296) = -1343
\]

Therefore, the final answer is \(-1343\).
</think>

To solve the expression:

\[
((-7 \times 9 - -9 + 7) + (9 \times -6 \times -4 \times -6))
\]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Evaluate \( (-7 \times 9 - -9 + 7) \):**
   
   - **Multiplication:**  
     \( -7 \times 9 = -63 \)
   
   - **Subtraction of a Negative:**  
     \( -63 - (-9) = -63 + 9 = -54 \)
   
   - **Addition:**  
     \( -54 + 7 = -47 \)

2. **Evaluate \( (9 \times -6 \times -4 \times -6) \):**
   
   - **Multiplication from left to right:**
     
     - First, \( 9 \times -6 = -54 \)
     
     - Then, \( -54 \times -4 = 216 \)
     
     - Finally, \( 216 \times -6 = -1296 \)

First, I'll simplify the first part of the equation: (4 - 3 * -1 * 3). According to the multiplication order from left to right, I'll multiply 3 by -1, which gives me -3. Then, I'll multiply that result by 3, resulting in -9. Finally, subtracting this from 4 gives me 4 - (-9) = 13.

Next, I'll simplify the second part of the equation: (3 + 8 + 1 - 7). I'll add 3 and 8 to get 11, then add 1 to make it 12. Finally, subtracting 7 from this gives me 5.

Now, I'll multiply the two results together: 13 * 5 = 65.

The final answer is 65.

**Solution:**

Let's solve the expression step by step following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

\[
(4 - 3 \times -1 \times 3) \times (3 + 8 + 1 - 7)
