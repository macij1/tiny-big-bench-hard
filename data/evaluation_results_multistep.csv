((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)) =,63,"<think>
Okay, let me try to solve this math problem step by step. So the expression is:

(-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those negative numbers and operations. I think I should break it down into smaller parts to make it manageable.

First, let me look at the part inside the first set of parentheses: (-9 * -5 - 6 + -2). I remember that when multiplying two negatives, the result is positive, right? So, -9 multiplied by -5 would be... uh... positive forty-five. Let me write that down:

-9 * -5 = 45

Okay, so now that part becomes 45. Next, I have to subtract 6 from that. So, 45 minus 6 is... hmm, that should be thirty-nine.

39 - 6 = 39

Wait, but then there's another negative sign before the 2, which makes it +(-2). So, we need to add -2 at the end. That means adding 2 to the current result. Let me do that:

39 + (-2) = 37

So, after simplifying the first part inside the parentheses, I get 37.

Now, let's move on to the second set of parentheses: (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1). This one has more operations, so I need to handle the multiplication before subtraction. Let me start with that:

First, compute -6 multiplied by -3. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, so that should be... uh... thirty-six.

-6 * -3 = 18

Now, multiply that result by 1. Well, anything multiplied by one is itself, so 18 * 1 is still 18.

So now the expression becomes:

-8 - 18

Wait a minute, subtracting 18 from -8? That would be like adding negative eighteen to negative eight. Let me think about that in terms of number lines or maybe some other way to visualize it.

If I have -8 and I subtract 18 more, where do I end up on the number line? Starting at -8, if I take 18 steps further to the left (since it's subtraction), I'll be at... let me count: from -8 to 0 is 8 steps, so that would make it -28. Then subtracting another 16 more steps would bring me down to -44? Wait, no, actually, if you subtract 18 from -8, it's like adding the negative of 18.

In other words:

-8 - 18 = -(8 + 18) = -26

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. If I have -8 and I take away 18, which is a larger number than 8, it should be negative. So yes, -8 - 18 is indeed -26.

So now, the second part inside the parentheses simplifies to -26.

Now, putting it all together:

The original expression was (37) - (-26)

Subtracting a negative number is like adding its positive counterpart, so that becomes:

37 + 26 = ?

Let me add those up. 30 + 20 is 50, and then 7 + 6 is 13. So 50 + 13 is 63.

So the final answer should be 63.

Wait, did I do all that correctly? Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First part: (-9 * -5) = 45

Then subtract 6: 45 - 6 = 39

Add (-2): 39 + (-2) = 37. That seems right.

Second part:

Start with -8, then subtract (-6 * -3 * 1). Let's do the multiplication first:

-6 * -3 is positive 18. Then, 18 * 1 is still 18.

So now we have: -8 - 18

Which is equal to -(8 + 18) = -26. That checks out.

Then subtracting (-26) from 37:

37 - (-26) is the same as 37 + 26, which is indeed 63.

Okay, so I think that's correct. All my steps seem logical and I double-checked them. So, yeah, the answer should be 63.
</think>

To solve the expression step by step:

1. Simplify inside each set of parentheses first:
   - For the first part: (-9 * -5) = 45; then subtract 6 to get 39, and add (-2) to get 37.
   - For the second part: First multiply -6 * -3 = 18; then multiply by 1 to still have 18. Subtract this from -8: -8 - 18 = -26.

2. Combine the results:
   - Subtract the second result (-26) from the first (37): 37 - (-26) = 37 + 26 = 63.

**Answer:** 63","<think>
First, evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses.

Starting with \(-9 \times -5\), which equals \(45\).

Then, subtract \(6\) from \(45\), resulting in \(39\).

Next, add \(-2\) to \(39\), giving a total of \(37\).

So, the first part simplifies to \(37\).

Moving on to the second parentheses: \(-8 - (-6 \times -3 \times 1)\).

First, calculate the multiplication inside the brackets: \(-6 \times -3 = 18\), and then \(18 \times 1 = 18\).

Subtracting this result from \(-8\) gives \(-8 - 18 = -26\).

Finally, subtract \(-26\) from \(37\): \(37 - (-26) = 63\).
</think>

**Solution:**

We need to evaluate the expression:

\[
((-9 \times -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - (-6 \times -3 \times 1)))
\]

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Evaluate inside the first parentheses:**
   
   \[
   -9 \times -5 = 45
   \]
   
   So, 
   
   \[
   45 - 6 + (-2) = 45 - 6 - 2 = 37
   \]
   
   **First part simplifies to:** \(37\)

2. **Evaluate inside the second parentheses:**
   
   First, calculate the multiplication:
   
   \[
   -6 \times -3 = 18
   \]
   
   Then multiply by 1 (which doesn't change the value):
   
   \[
   18 \times 1 = 18
   \]
   
   Now, subtract this result from \(-8\):
   
   \[
   -8 - 18 = -26
   \]
   
   **Second part simplifies to:** \(-26\)

3. **Combine the two parts:**
   
   Subtract the second result from the first:
   
   \[
   37 - (-26) = 37 + 26 = 63
   \]

With these results, the original expression becomes: \((-9 \times -5) - (-2) - 18 - (-2)\).

I'll compute \(-9 \times -5\) to get \(45\).

Now, the expression is \(45 - (-2) - 18 - (-2)\), which simplifies to \(45 + 2 - 18 + 2 = 31\).

I'll start by simplifying the expression inside each set of parentheses. 

First, I'll calculate (3 * -3 * 6). Multiplying 3 and -3 gives -9, then multiplying that by 6 results in -54.

Next, I'll handle (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7). Combining the negative numbers: -2 minus 7 is -9. Then subtracting another 7 makes it -16. Finally, adding 7 (since subtracting a negative is like adding) brings us to -9.

((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 * 6)) =,58,"<think>
Okay, so I've got this math problem here: (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 * 6). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First off, there are two main parts to this expression inside the parentheses: one is (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0), and the other is (1 + -4 - -9 * 6). I need to solve each part separately and then add them together at the end.

Starting with the first part: (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0). Okay, so let's tackle this. Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, right? So -6 minus -4 becomes -6 plus 4. That would be -2. Then I add 9 to that, so -2 + 9 equals 7. And then adding 0 doesn't change anything, so the first part simplifies to 7.

Now onto the second part: (1 + -4 - -9 * 6). This seems a bit more complicated because of the multiplication involved and the negative signs. Let's handle the multiplication first since it has higher precedence in order of operations. So -9 multiplied by 6 is... wait, that would be -54, right? Because multiplying two negatives makes a positive, but here one is positive and the other is negative. So yeah, -54.

So now, substituting back into the expression: 1 + (-4) - (-54). Again, subtracting a negative is adding a positive, so this becomes 1 - 4 + 54. Let's compute that step by step. First, 1 minus 4 is -3. Then, -3 plus 54 equals 51.

So now I have both parts: the first part was 7 and the second part is 51. The original expression adds these two results together, so 7 + 51 gives me... let's see, 7 plus 50 is 57, and then adding 1 more makes it 58.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't mix up any signs or numbers. Starting again:

First part: (-6 - -4 + 9 + 0). So -6 minus a negative is plus 4, so -6 + 4 = -2. Then adding 9 gives 7. Adding 0 doesn't change that, so yes, first part is 7.

Second part: (1 + -4 - (-54)). Again, subtracting a negative is adding positive, so 1 - 4 + 54. 1 minus 4 is -3, plus 54 is indeed 51.

Adding those two results together: 7 + 51 equals 58. So I think that's correct.
</think>

The expression simplifies as follows:

\[
((-6 - -4 + 9 + 0) + (1 + -4 - -9 \times 6)) = (-2 + 9 + 0) + (1 - 4 + 54) = 7 + 51 = 58
\]

**Answer:** 58","<think>
I need to evaluate the expression (-6 - (-4) + 9 + 0) + (1 + (-4) - (-9) × 6).

First, I'll simplify the first group of numbers inside the first parentheses. Subtracting a negative is like adding, so -(-4) becomes +4.

Now the expression looks like: (-6 + 4 + 9 + 0). Adding these together gives me 7.

Next, I'll work on the second set of numbers inside the second parentheses. Again, subtracting a negative turns into addition, and multiplying first due to the order of operations: -(-9) × 6 becomes 54.

So now the expression is simplified to (1 + (-4) + 54). Adding these together results in 51.

Finally, I add the two results from each parentheses: 7 + 51 equals 58.

Sure, let's solve the expression step by step:

\[
((-6 - (-4) + 9 + 0) ) + (1 + (-4) - (-9 \times 6))

**Step 1:** Simplify inside each set of parentheses.

1. **First Parentheses:**
   \[
   -6 - (-4) + 9 + 0
   \]
   
   Subtracting a negative is like adding:
   \[
   -6 + 4 + 9 + 0 = (-6 + 4) + (9 + 0) = (-2) + 9 = 7
   \]

2. **Second Parentheses:**
   \[
   1 + (-4) - (-9 \times 6)
   \]
   
   First, perform the multiplication:
   \[
   -9 \times 6 = -54
   \]
   
   Then subtracting a negative is adding:
   \[
   1 - 4 + 54 = (1 - 4) + 54 = (-3) + 54 = 51
   \]

**Step 2:** Add the results of both parentheses.
\[
7 + 51 = 58

**Final Answer:**

First, I will simplify the first part of the expression inside the parentheses.

I start by adding and subtracting the numbers sequentially:

Next, I add \(9\) to \(-2\), resulting in \(7\). Finally, I add \(0\), which doesn't change the value.

So, the first part simplifies to \(7\).

Now, I will simplify the second part of the expression inside the parentheses.

I start with adding \(1\) and subtracting \(4\), which gives \(-3\).

Then, I multiply \(-9\) by \(6\) to get \(-54\). Subtracting this from \(-3\) results in \(-57\).

So, the second part simplifies to \(-57\).

Finally, I will combine both parts of the expression:

First, I will simplify each part of the expression separately.

For the first part:
-6 minus negative 4 is equal to -6 plus 4, which equals -2.
Adding 9 to -2 gives 7.
Adding 0 to 7 remains 7.

For the second part:
1 plus negative 4 is equal to 1 minus 4, which equals -3.
Subtracting negative 9 multiplied by 6 requires first calculating -9 times 6, which equals -54. Then, subtracting -54 from -3 is the same as adding 54 to -3, resulting in 51.

Finally, I add the results of both parts together: 7 plus 51 equals 58.

((-6 - 4 * 2 - 6) + (1 + -2 * 1 * 7)) =,-33,"<think>
Alright, let's tackle this math problem step by step. I have the expression:

\[
(-6 - 4 \times 2 - 6) + (1 + (-2 \times 1 \times 7))
\]

Okay, so first, I need to remember the order of operations—PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. Got it.

Looking at the expression, there are two main parts inside parentheses that we need to simplify separately. Let's handle each part one by one.

Starting with the first set of parentheses:

\[
-6 - 4 \times 2 - 6
\]

First, I see a multiplication here: \(4 \times 2\). Let me calculate that. 

\(4 \times 2 = 8\)

So now, substituting back into the expression:

\[
-6 - 8 - 6
\]

Next, I need to perform the subtraction from left to right.

Starting with \(-6 - 8\):

\(-6 - 8 = -14\)

Now, subtracting another 6:

\(-14 - 6 = -20\)

Okay, so the first part simplifies to \(-20\).

Moving on to the second set of parentheses:

\[
1 + (-2 \times 1 \times 7)
\]

Again, I see multiplication. Let's handle that first.

Multiplying from left to right: \( -2 \times 1 \) is straightforward.

\(-2 \times 1 = -2\)

Now, continuing with the next operation:

\(-2 \times 7 = -14\)

So substituting back into the expression:

\[
1 + (-14)
\]

Adding these together:

\(1 - 14 = -13\)

Alright, so the second part simplifies to \(-13\).

Now, putting it all back together, we have:

First part: \(-20\)

Second part: \(-13\)

So adding them together:

\[
-20 + (-13) = -33
\]

Therefore, the final result should be \(-33\).

To solve the expression \((-6 - 4 \times 2 - 6) + (1 + (-2 \times 1 \times 7))\), we'll simplify each part inside the parentheses separately using the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply \(4 \times 2 = 8\).
2. Substitute back:

1. Multiply from left to right:
   \[
   -2 \times 1 = -2 \\
   -2 \times 7 = -14

2. Substitute back:
   \[
   1 + (-14) = 1 - 14 = -13

- \( -6 - 8 = -14 \)
- Then, \( -14 - 6 = -20 \)

So, the first part simplifies to \(-20\).

Now, I'll evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses: \(1 + (-2) \times 1 \times 7\).

Again, following the order of operations, multiplication comes before addition. First, calculate \((-2) \times 1 = -2\), and then multiply that by 7 to get \(-14\).

First, I need to evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses. It is (-6) minus four multiplied by two and then minus six.

Then, I'll subtract another 6 from this result: -14 minus 6 equals -20.

So, the value of the first set of parentheses is -20.

Now, moving on to the second set of parentheses, which is (1) plus negative two multiplied by one and then multiplied by seven.

((1 - 0 + 1 - 4) - (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8)) =,49,"<think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here: ((1 - 0 + 1 - 4) - (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all the parentheses and negative signs, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to remember the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). But in this problem, I see multiple sets of parentheses, so maybe I should work from the inside out.

Looking at the expression:

((1 - 0 + 1 - 4) - (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8))

I think the first step is to solve what's inside the innermost parentheses. So starting with (1 - 0 + 1 - 4). Let me compute that.

Starting from the left: 1 minus 0 is 1, then plus 1 makes it 2, and then minus 4 brings it down to -2. So the first part simplifies to -2.

Now, the expression becomes:

(-2) - (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8)

Alright, now I need to handle the next set of parentheses: (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8). Let's tackle this step by step. First, do the multiplications inside first.

Starting with -3 multiplied by 1. Hmm, multiplying a negative by a positive gives a negative result, so that should be -3 * 1 = -3.

Next, we have -6 multiplied by -8. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, so (-6)*(-8) is +48.

Now, the expression inside becomes: -3 minus (-3 - (-3? Wait no, hold on. Let me check that again.)

Wait, in the expression (-3 * 1 - -6 * -8), after computing the multiplications, it's (-3) - (48). Because we had -3 from the first multiplication and then subtracted (-6)*(-8)=+48.

So now the entire inner parentheses are: -3 minus (+48). That means -3 - 48. Subtracting a positive is just moving left on the number line, so that would be -51.

Wait a second, but let me double-check that because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Starting with (-3 * 1): -3 * 1 = -3.

Then (-6 * -8) = +48.

So now we have: (-3) - (+48). Which is the same as (-3) minus 48, which equals -51. Okay, that seems right.

Now, going back to the main expression:

(First part) -2 - (Second part) where Second part is -51.

So it's now: -2 - (-51). Subtracting a negative is like adding its positive counterpart. So this becomes -2 + 51.

Finally, -2 plus 51 is... Let's see, starting at -2 and adding 51 brings us to 49. Because 50 would bring it to 48, but since we started at -2, it's 51 units away from there.

So the final result should be 49.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any signs somewhere. It's easy to get confused with multiple negatives.

First part: (1 - 0 + 1 - 4) = -2. That seems right because adding and subtracting sequentially:

1 - 0 is 1,

1 + 1 is 2,

2 - 4 is -2.

Second part: (-3 * 1) is -3,

(-6 * -8) is +48,

So -3 minus (+48) is -51. Correct.

Then, the main expression is (-2) - (-51). Subtracting a negative is adding positive, so it's -2 + 51 = 49.

Yes, that seems consistent. I think I did that correctly. It's easy to mix up the signs when there are multiple negatives involved, but going step by step and double-checking each part helps avoid mistakes.
</think>

The solution is calculated as follows:

First, simplify inside the innermost parentheses:
\[
1 - 0 + 1 - 4 = (1) + (1) + (-4) = -2
\]

Next, compute the multiplication parts inside the next set of parentheses:
\[
-3 \times 1 = -3
\]
\[
-6 \times -8 = +48
\]

Subtract these results within the same parentheses:
\[
-3 - (-6 \times -8) = -3 - 48 = -51
\]

Finally, subtract the result of the second set of parentheses from the first:
\[
(-2) - (-51) = -2 + 51 = 49
\]

**Answer:** 49","<think>
First, I need to evaluate the expression inside each set of parentheses step by step.

Starting with \( (1 - 0 + 1 - 4) \):
- Subtracting 0 from 1 gives 1.
- Adding another 1 results in 2.
- Subtracting 4 from 2 yields -2.

Next, I evaluate the second part inside the parentheses: \( (-3 \times 1 - (-6) \times (-8)) \).
- Multiplying -3 by 1 gives -3.
- Multiplying -6 by -8 results in 48 (since a negative times a negative is positive).
- Subtracting 48 from -3 leads to -51.

Finally, I subtract the second result from the first:
- Subtracting -51 from -2 is equivalent to adding 51 to -2.
- Adding these together results in 49.

Okay, so I have this math problem here: ((1 + 7 * -9 + -5) + (3 + -5 * 2 - 6)). Hmm, let me try to figure out how to solve it step by step. First, I remember that when solving expressions with parentheses and operations inside them, I should follow the order of operations, often remembered by PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Looking at this problem, there are two main parts within the parentheses: one is 1 + 7 * -9 + -5, and the other is 3 + (-5) * 2 - 6. I think I should handle each part separately first before combining them.

Starting with the first part: (1 + 7 * -9 + -5). Inside this, there's a multiplication: 7 multiplied by -9. Let me calculate that. So, 7 times negative 9 is... hmm, positive or negative? Since one of them is negative, the result should be negative. 7 * 9 is 63, so it should be -63. Now, I can rewrite the expression: 1 + (-63) + -5.

Adding those together: 1 plus (-63) is like subtracting 63 from 1, which gives me -62. Then adding another negative 5: -62 plus (-5) equals... well, that's just adding a negative number, so I end up with -67.

Alright, now moving on to the second part inside its own parentheses: (3 + (-5) * 2 - 6). Again, there's a multiplication here: -5 multiplied by 2. Multiplying two numbers where one is negative and the other is positive should give me a negative result. So, -5 * 2 = -10.

Now the expression becomes: 3 + (-10) - 6. Let's break that down step by step. Starting with 3 plus (-10). That's like subtracting 10 from 3, which gives me -7. Then I have to subtract 6 more: -7 minus 6 equals... well, adding a negative number again, so it's -13.

Now that I've solved both parts inside the parentheses, I need to add them together because there are two sets of parentheses separated by a plus sign in the original expression. So, the first part is -67 and the second part is -13. Adding those together: (-67) + (-13). Since both numbers are negative, adding them will result in a more negative number. 

Let me do the math: 67 plus 13 is 80, so adding two negatives gives me -80.

Wait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the first part:

1 + (7 * -9) + (-5)
= 1 + (-63) + (-5)
= 1 - 63 - 5
= (1 - 63) = -62; then -62 - 5 = -67. That seems right.

Now the second part:

(3 + (-5) * 2 - 6)
= 3 + (-10) - 6
= 3 - 10 = -7; -7 - 6 = -13. Also looks correct.

Adding them together: -67 + (-13) = -80. Yep, that checks out.

Now, let's solve the expression step by step.

First part: \(1 + (7 \times -9) + (-5)\)

Calculate multiplication first:
\(-5 \times 2 = -10\)

Now add the numbers:
\(3 + (-10) - 6 = 3 - 10 - 6 = -13\)

Finally, add both results together:
\(-67 + (-13) = -80\)

**Answer:** \boxed{-80}","<think>

- Multiply 7 by \(-9\) to get \(-63\).
- Then add 1 and subtract 5 from \(-63\) to obtain \(-67\).

Next, for the second part, \(3 + (-5) \times 2 - 6\):
- Multiply \(-5\) by 2 to get \(-10\).
- Add 3 and subtract 6 from \(-10\) to get \(-13\).

Finally, I'll add the results of both parts: \(-67 + (-13)\) equals \(-80\).

I start by evaluating the expression inside the first set of parentheses.

First, I calculate \(-7 \times -9\), which equals \(63\) because multiplying two negative numbers results in a positive product. Next, I compute \(8 \times -3\), which is \(-24\) since multiplying a positive number by a negative number gives a negative result. Adding these two products together: \(63 + (-24) = 39\).

((-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7)) =,20,"<think>
Okay, so I have this math problem here: ((-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those operations inside the parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll focus on the part inside the first set of parentheses: (-9 - 1 * 5 * -5). Alright, let's handle the multiplication part before doing anything else because according to PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), I should do that first. 

So, in this multiplication, it's 1 multiplied by 5, which is 5, and then multiplied by -5. Wait, actually, let me make sure: the expression is (-9) minus (1 * 5 * -5). So, breaking it down:

- Start with 1 * 5 = 5.
- Then multiply that result by -5: 5 * (-5) = -25.

Wait a second, hold on. Is it 1 multiplied by 5 multiplied by -5? Yes, that's correct. So, that part becomes -25. Now, going back to the expression:

(-9) minus (the multiplication result). So, -25. That means I'm subtracting -25 from -9. Hmm, okay.

So, now the first part simplifies to: (-9) - (-25). Subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, so this becomes -9 + 25. Let's calculate that: -9 + 25 = 16. Got that down for the first parentheses.

Now, moving on to the second set of parentheses: (6 + -3 - -1 * -7). Again, let's handle the multiplication part before adding or subtracting.

Looking at it: 6 + (-3) - (-1 * -7). So, inside there is a multiplication: -1 multiplied by -7. Remember that negative times negative is positive, so that becomes +7.

So now, plugging back in: 6 + (-3) - (+7). Simplifying this step by step:

- First, 6 + (-3) is the same as 6 - 3, which equals 3.
- Then subtracting 7 from that result: 3 - 7 = -4.

So, the second parentheses simplifies to -4.

Now, putting it all together, we have the first part minus the second part:

16 (from the first parentheses) minus (-4) (from the second). Subtracting a negative is adding a positive, so this becomes 16 + 4 = 20.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting with the first part: -9 - 1*5*-5. We did 1*5=5, then *-5=-25, then subtracted that from -9, which became -9 +25=16. Correct.

Second part: 6+(-3)-(-1*-7). Multiplication first: (-1)*-7=+7. So, 6 + (-3)=3, minus +7 is -4. Correct.

Subtracting the second result from the first: 16 - (-4) = 16 +4=20. Looks good.

I think that's it. The final answer should be 20.
</think>

The expression simplifies as follows:

First part:
\[
(-9 - (1 \times 5 \times -5)) = (-9 - (-25)) = -9 + 25 = 16
\]

Second part:
\[
(6 + (-3) - (-1 \times -7)) = (6 - 3 - 7) = (-4)
\]

Final calculation:
\[
16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20
\]

The final answer is $\boxed{20}$.","<think>
First, I'll address the operations inside each parentheses separately.

Starting with the first part: -9 minus 1 times 5 times -5. According to the order of operations, multiplication comes before subtraction.

Calculating 1 multiplied by 5 gives 5, and then multiplying that by -5 results in -25. So now I have -9 minus (-25).

Subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding its positive value. Therefore, -9 plus 25 equals 16.

Next, moving on to the second part inside the parentheses: 6 plus -3 minus (-1 multiplied by -7). Again, following the order of operations, I'll handle the multiplication first.

Multiplying -1 by -7 gives 7. Now, substituting that back into the expression, it becomes 6 plus -3 minus 7.

Adding and subtracting sequentially: 6 plus -3 equals 3, and then subtracting 7 results in -4.

Finally, I'll subtract the second result from the first part: 16 minus (-4). Subtracting a negative is like adding its positive value, so 16 plus 4 equals 20.
</think>

To solve the expression:

\[
((-9 - 1 \times 5 \times -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 \times -7))
\]

Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify inside each set of parentheses.

#### First Parentheses:
\[
-9 - 1 \times 5 \times (-5)
\]
According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform multiplication before subtraction.

1. Multiply \(1 \times 5 = 5\).
2. Then multiply \(5 \times (-5) = -25\).

Now, substitute back:
\[
-9 - (-25)
\]
Subtracting a negative is the same as adding its positive:
\[
-9 + 25 = 16
\]

---

#### Second Parentheses:
\[
6 + (-3) - (-1 \times -7)
\]
Again, handle multiplication first.

1. Multiply \(-1 \times -7 = 7\) (since a negative times a negative is positive).

Now, substitute back:
\[
6 + (-3) - 7
\]
Simplify step by step:
\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]
Then,
\[
3 - 7 = -4
\]

---

### Step 2: Subtract the second parentheses from the first.

We have already simplified both parts:

\[
16 - (-4)
\]
Subtracting a negative is like adding its positive:
\[
16 + 4 = 20

  - Then multiply by \(-5\):
    \[
    5 \times (-5) = -25

  - Now subtract from \(-9\):
    \[
    -9 - (-25) = -9 + 25 = 16
    \]

- **Second Parenthesis:**
  \[
  (6 + (-3) - (-1 \times -7))

  - Multiply first:
    \[
    -1 \times -7 = 7
    \]
  - Now perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
    \[
    6 + (-3) = 3
    \]
    \[
    3 - 7 = -4
    \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Second Result from the First

Now, subtract the result of the second parenthesis from the first:

\[
16 - (-4) = 16 + 4 = 20

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{20}

((6 - 0 * 5 + -3) * (6 - -7 + -2 - -7)) =,54,"<think>
Okay, so I've got this math problem here that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it will make more sense. Let me see... It's written as:

((6 - 0 * 5 + -3) * (6 - (-7) + -2 - -7)) = ?

Alright, so there are two main parts here inside parentheses: the first one is (6 - 0 * 5 + -3), and the second one is (6 - (-7) + -2 - -7). Then I have to multiply the results of these two separate calculations together. Cool, that seems manageable.

Let me start with the first part: (6 - 0 * 5 + -3). Hmm, there's a multiplication here too—0 times 5. I remember from school that when you see something like a * b, it means you multiply them. So, 0 multiplied by 5 is... zero! That's straightforward.

So now, the first part simplifies to (6 - 0 + -3). Okay, so let me compute that step by step:

First, 6 minus 0 is just 6. Then, adding (-3) would mean subtracting 3 from that result. So, 6 minus 3 equals 3. Got it.

Alright, now onto the second part: (6 - (-7) + -2 - -7). This looks a bit more involved because of all those negative numbers and the subtraction signs. Let me tackle each operation one by one to avoid confusion.

Starting with 6 minus (-7). I recall that subtracting a negative is like adding its positive counterpart. So, 6 minus (-7) becomes 6 plus 7, which equals 13. That's a good start.

Next up is adding -2 to this result. So, 13 plus (-2) would be the same as 13 minus 2, right? Which gives me 11. Okay, so now I'm at 11.

Finally, we have subtracting -7 from that number. Again, subtracting a negative is like adding its positive counterpart. So, 11 minus (-7) translates to 11 plus 7, which equals 18. Nice, got the final result for this part as well: 18.

Now, going back to the original expression, we have both parts computed:

First part: 3

Second part: 18

And they are multiplied together: 3 * 18.

Let me do that multiplication. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 8 is 24. So, adding those together gives me 54. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression should be 54.

Wait a minute, did I handle all the negative signs correctly? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to mix up the signs with multiple negatives and additions and subtractions.

Starting again:

First part: (6 - 0 * 5 + -3)

- Compute 0 * 5 first: 0
- So, it's now (6 - 0 + (-3)) which is the same as (6 - 3)
- Which equals 3. That seems correct.

Second part: (6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7))

Let me go through each operation again:

1. 6 - (-7): This becomes 6 + 7 = 13
2. Then, adding (-2): 13 + (-2) = 11
3. Subtracting (-7): 11 - (-7) = 11 + 7 = 18

All right, that still gives me the same results: 3 and 18. Multiplying them together is straightforward:

3 * 18 = 54.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check if I did the order of operations correctly in each part. In the first part, there are no exponents or division here; it's only addition and subtraction. So, left to right from left to right would work.

Similarly, in the second part: 6 - (-7) is straightforward, but let me ensure that I didn't make a mistake with the signs when adding and subtracting. Since there are multiple negative numbers, keeping track of each one's effect is crucial. Breaking it down:

- Original expression: 6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7)
- Which translates to: 6 + 7 (because minus a negative is plus) + (-2) + 7 (another minus, so the last negative becomes positive)

So adding those together: 6 + 7 = 13; 13 - 2 = 11; 11 + 7 = 18. That seems consistent.

Alright, I think my calculations are solid here. Let me just write down each step neatly to ensure clarity:

First part:
(6 - (0 * 5) + (-3))
= (6 - 0 + (-3))
= (6 - 0) + (-3)
= 6 - 3
= 3

Second part:
(6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7))
= 6 + 7 + (-2) + 7
= (6 + 7) + (-2 + 7)
= 13 + 5
= 18

Multiplying the two results:
3 * 18 = 54

Yep, everything checks out. I think that's the correct answer.
</think>

The given expression simplifies to:

((6 - 0 * 5 + -3) * (6 - (-7) + -2 - -7))  
= ((6 - 0 + -3) * (6 + 7 + -2 + 7))  
= (3 * 18)  
= 54

**Answer:** 54","<think>
I need to evaluate the expression step by step.

First, I'll simplify the first part of the multiplication inside the first parentheses:
\( 6 - 0 \times 5 + (-3) = 6 - 0 + (-3) = 6 - 3 = 3 \).

Next, I'll simplify the second part of the multiplication inside the second parentheses:
\( 6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7) = 6 + 7 - 2 + 7 = 18 \).

Now, I'll multiply the two results together:
\( 3 \times 18 = 54 \).
</think>

Sure, let's solve the expression step by step.

**Given Expression:**
\[
(6 - 0 \times 5 + (-3)) \times (6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7))
\]

Let's simplify each part inside the parentheses first.

---

**Step 1:** Simplify the first parentheses:
\[
6 - 0 \times 5 + (-3)
\]
- Multiply \(0\) by \(5\):
\[
6 - 0 = 6
\]
- Add \(-3\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 3):
\[
6 + (-3) = 6 - 3 = 3
\]

So, the first parentheses simplifies to:
\[
3
\]

---

**Step 2:** Simplify the second parentheses:
\[
6 - (-7) + (-2) - (-7)
\]
- Subtracting a negative is like adding:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]
- Adding \(-2\) (which is equivalent to subtracting 2):
\[
13 - 2 = 11
\]
- Subtracting another negative \(7\) is like adding:
\[
11 + 7 = 18
\]

So, the second parentheses simplifies to:
\[
18
\]

**Step 3:** Multiply the results of both parentheses:
\[
3 \times 18 = 54
\]

First, I will evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses. Starting with \(6 - 0 \times 5\), since multiplication takes precedence over subtraction, I calculate \(0 \times 5 = 0\). This simplifies the expression to \(6 - 0 = 6\).

Next, I simplify the remaining terms in the first parentheses: \(6 + (-3)\) equals \(3\).

Moving on to the second set of parentheses, I start with \(6 - (-7)\), which is equivalent to \(6 + 7 = 13\). Then, subtracting \(-2\) from this result gives \(13 + 2 = 15\). Finally, subtracting another \(-7\) results in \(15 + 7 = 22\).

Now, I multiply the simplified values of both sets of parentheses: \(3 \times 22 = 66\).
