((-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) - (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)) =,63,"To solve this multi-step arithmetic problem, we need to follow the order of operations, which is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Let's break down the equation step by step:

First, let's calculate the expressions inside the parentheses:

A = (-9 * -5 - 6 + -2) = ?

Multiplication comes first, so we multiply -9 and -5:
-9 * -5 = 45

Now, add 6 to get:
45 + 6 = 51

Subtract 2:
51 - 2 = 49

So, A = 49.

Next, let's calculate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:

B = (-8 - -6 * -3 * 1)

Multiplication comes first, so we multiply -6 and -3:
-6 * -3 = 18

Now, multiply by 1 (which doesn't change the value):
18 * 1 = 18

Subtract -8 (which is equivalent to adding 8):
B = -8 + 18 = 10

Now that we have A and B, let's substitute them back into the original equation:
A - B = 49 - 10 = 39

So, the final answer is: 39"

1. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   Inside the first parentheses: 
      First, multiply -3 * 6 = -18.
      Then, add and subtract from left to right: 
         (3 * (-3 * 6) + -5) = (3 * -18 + -5) = (-54) + -5 = -59
   Inside the second parentheses:
      First, subtract -7 - -7 = -7 - 7 = -14.
      Then add and subtract from left to right: 
         (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7) = (-2 + -7 - 7) = (-9)

So now we have (3 * -3 * 6 + -5) - (-2 + -7 - 7 - -7) = -59 - (-9).

2. Subtract a negative number is the same as adding a positive number:
   So, -59 - (-9) = -59 + 9 = -50.

So the answer to this equation is -50."

   (-36 * 8) = -288
8. The equation now becomes: (-288 * 1) * 40
9. Finally, let's multiply -288 by 1 (which is equal to -288), then by 40:

So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses simplifies to 7.

2. Now look at the second set of parentheses:

Now add that result back into the expression:

((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4)) =,25,"To solve this equation, let's follow the order of operations:

First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses. Let's calculate the values inside each set of parentheses.

Inside the first parentheses:
(9 - 3 + 2 + -1)

Using the correct order of operations (PEMDAS), we can rewrite this as:
(9 - 3) + 2 + (-1)
= 6 + 2 + (-1)
= 8 + (-1)
= 7

Inside the second parentheses:
(5 - -1 - -6 * -4)

Using the correct order of operations (PEMDAS), we can rewrite this as:
(5 - (-1)) - (-6 * -4)
= (5 + 1) - (-6 * -4)
= 6 - (-6 * -4)
= 6 - (-24)
= 6 + 24
= 30

Now that we have the values inside each set of parentheses, let's substitute them back into the original equation:
((9 - 3 + 2 + -1) - (5 - -1 - -6 * -4)) =
(7) - (30)

Next, we need to perform the subtraction operation:

((3 + -1 * 7 * -6) - (-7 * -1 + -5 - -3)) =,40,"To solve this equation step by step, let's break it down into parts as we did before. This time the equation can be written as ""C - D"", where C = (3 + (-1 * 7 * -6)) and D = ((-7 * -1) + (-5 - (-3))).

Step 1: Calculate C
We start with C = (3 + (-1 * 7 * -6)). First, we solve the multiplication inside the parentheses. Since multiplication is order of operations follows before addition or subtraction according to PEDMAS, it gives:
(-1 * 7 * -6) = -1 * 42 = -42

Now let's rewrite C as (3 + (-42)) since that’s what we found out from previous step.
So now c equals to: 
C = (3 + (-42))

Combine the numbers inside the parentheses by adding and subtracting:
(3 + (-42)) = 3 - 42 = -39

Step 2: Calculate D
Next, let's calculate D. We have ((-7 * -1) + (-5 - (-3))). Let’s start with what we find out in previous step to the order of operations first which is multiplication then proceed with addition and subtraction from left to right:
-7 * -1 = 7 (because a negative multiplied by another negative gives a positive)
Now the equation D can be written as: ((7) + (-5 - (-3)))

Inside the parentheses, we perform the operation between (-5) and (-3):
(-5 - (-3)) = -5 + 3 = -2

So now D is equal to:
((7) + (-2))

Combine the numbers inside the parentheses by adding and subtracting:
(7 + (-2)) = 7 - 2 = 5

Step 3: Calculate C - D
We have calculated both parts of our original equation as follows:
C = -39
D = 5 

Let’s write down now what we need to solve this equation which is: C – D
Now let's perform the subtraction operation between c and d:
C – D = (-39) – (5)
Combine numbers inside parentheses by adding and subtracting according to their sign. Remember that minus - before a number means we have to add it, so it becomes an addition now:
(-39) – (5) = (-39 + 5)"

 Inside the first set of parentheses:

Then, add -3 (which is negative 3) to that result. That becomes 0 + (-3), or -3.

So we now have: (-3 - 2)

Next, perform the subtraction of 2 from -3, which gives us -5.

 Inside the second set of parentheses:
(8 - 2 + -8 - -6)
First, subtract 2 from 8 to get 6.
Then add -8 (which is negative 8) to that result. That becomes 6 + (-8), or -2.

Next, add -6 to that result (remembering that we're adding a negative number). This gives us -2 + (-6), which equals -8.

Now that we have the two simplified expressions, we can combine them:
(-5) + (-8)

We perform the addition of these two numbers, getting -13.

So, the first set of parentheses evaluates to 37.

(-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)

First, calculate the subtraction of a negative, which is equivalent to addition:
-4 - (-4) = -4 + 4
= 0

Now, substitute this value into the expression:
(-4 - 1 - 0 - 4)

Next, evaluate the addition and subtraction from left to right:
-4 - 1 = -5
-5 - 0 = -5 (because subtracting zero doesn't change the value)
-5 - 4 = -9

So, the second set of parentheses evaluates to -9.

Now, let's substitute these values back into the original equation and simplify:
((4 + 7 * 4 - -5) - (-4 - 1 - -4 - 4)) =
37 - (-9)

When subtracting a negative number, it is equivalent to adding the positive value of that number. So, we can rewrite this expression as:
